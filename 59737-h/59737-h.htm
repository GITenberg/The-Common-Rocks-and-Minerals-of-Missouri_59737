<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Missourians are interested in the rocks and minerals which they
find on their farms, in excavations, and while on their vacation trips.
Some of the specimens are unusual in shape or appearance, some are
crystalline and beautiful, some may be ores of economic importance,
but many simply arouse the curiosity of the finder.</p>
<p>Many of these specimens are received each year at the University
at Columbia, and each is usually accompanied by a request for information
on the correct name for the specimen, its composition, its commercial
value, and the manner of its formation.</p>
<p>Frequently the requests include questions of a broader geological
nature, or seek the recommendation of a general, easily-read book
written on rocks and minerals which may be purchased at a book
store or consulted at a library. Moreover, many persons ask how they
may determine for themselves the geological specimens which they
have collected.</p>
<p>This little booklet has been prepared with the intention of answering
the questions most commonly asked by citizens of the state about
Missouri rocks and minerals.</p>
<p>Descriptions and photographs of Missouri rock and mineral
occurrences are provided, and essential facts about the geological
conditions of their formation are simply told. A determinative key
is supplied in order that the reader may identify and name most of
the common specimens which he collects within the state (and elsewhere,
also). No special determinative equipment will be suggested,
and only non-technical language will be employed because the chief
objective here is to furnish a useful, understandable geological account
of the <i>common</i> Missouri rocks and minerals to the average
person without geological training. In fact, for the purposes of
identification no differentiation is made between mineral and rock,
although the professional geologist does separate them in definition.
For our purpose, a rock is an aggregate of mineral particles, but a
mineral is a substance (without life) having more definite and constant
properties than a rock. For those interested further, more
technical and more nearly correct definitions, with explanations, are
given at the back, on <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The rarer minerals and those requiring special equipment for
determination may be sent to the Department of Geology of the University
of Missouri at Columbia for identification free of charge.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Names used locally, and sometimes incorrectly from a strictly
technical sense, for rocks and minerals will follow the generally
accepted names, and both will be duplicated in the index at the back
of the pamphlet to facilitate finding either one.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">DETERMINATIVE KEY</span></h2>
<p>A rock or mineral specimen which is unfamiliar to the collector
may be identified by using the information in this booklet in either
of two ways: (1) the reader may turn through the pages and compare
his specimen with the photographs of others named there and
read their descriptions until he finds a match for his specimen; or
(2), the better way, he may classify his specimen first by the use of
the determinative key which follows and be directed thereby to the
pages in the book for confirmation of the name by the photographs,
description, and discussion of the substance. The writer recommends
the second method and has prepared this booklet on the assumption
that the determinative key will be used.</p>
<p>The simplest and probably the best means of separating specimens
of different rocks and minerals is on the basis of hardness,
which means <i>resistance to scratching</i>. Crushing strength is different
from hardness; therefore, in testing for hardness, do not attempt to
pulverize. Merely determine if the specimen can be scratched with
the substance indicated.</p>
<p>Determination of the mark or &ldquo;streak&rdquo; of a mineral when rubbed
on a hard white rock or unglazed porcelain is demonstrated in the
photograph on <a href="#Page_56">page 56</a>.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">ROCK AND MINERAL DESCRIPTIONS</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4"><b id="g_Limestone">Limestone</b> and Dolomite</h3>
<p>Limestone is a bedded or layered rock found abundantly in Missouri
in bluffs, creek beds, hill sides, and is known to underlie the
soil in most of the south half of the state. It occurs in thin slabs,
thick layers, and in massive beds which may make a small cliff in
themselves. Limestone is soft enough to be scratched with steel. It
is commonly white to grayish, but may be stained tan, yellowish, or
reddish by iron oxide, or darkened through shades of gray to black
by the presence of very finely-divided, black carbonaceous matter.
It may be microscopically fine-grained (and then it can be used in
lithographic printing in the reproduction of very fine images), or
its grains may vary in size up to one-half inch in cross section.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="327" />
<p class="pcap">Limestone (dolomite) bluff near Jefferson City.</p>
</div>
<p>It is determined as limestone with certainty by wetting with dilute
cold acid; then it &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; or effervesces, and eventually dissolves
entirely. Ordinary or regular limestone contains the mineral calcite,
but the magnesian variety of limestone, dolomite, contains the mineral
dolomite, which does not effervesce freely in lump size in dilute acid,
but which does effervesce when <i>powdered</i> or when treated with hot
acid or concentrated acid. The preferred acid to use is muriatic
(hydrochloric, the &ldquo;not-cut&rdquo; soldering acid) diluted one part of acid
to one part of water. Caution! This acid mixture should be stored
in a glass or porcelain container away from children or animals!
Acid strong enough to dissolve rock will ruin clothes, destroy flesh,
and is poisonous! Dilute sulphuric (storage battery) acid will also
give the effervescence test, and the acid of very strong vinegar will
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
react with limestone slowly. In making the test it should be recognized
that the limestone which acts as a cement in sandstone, or limestone
impurities in shale will also effervesce, but those minor parts
of the rock will dissolve and leave the residues of sandstone or shale,
which are insoluble.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Some limestones are chemical deposits but many are consolidated
accumulations of fossil shells and shell fragments&mdash;organic limestone.
For example, a widespread limestone, the so-called Burlington limestone,
extending across central Missouri, contains many crinoid stem
fragments and plates, attesting to the abundance of crinoids living
in the sea at the time this limestone was laid down. Crinoids are
sea animals which, because of their branching structure and superficial
resemblance to plants, have been nicknamed &ldquo;sea lilies.&rdquo; Except
for calcareous cave and spring deposits, almost all limestone formations
in Missouri contain a few fossils of animals which lived in the
ocean, and therefore Missouri limestones are considered marine in
origin. They offer evidence for the very interesting land-sea changes
which this state has undergone in the geologic past.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="507" />
<p class="pcap">Limestone composed almost entirely of crinoid (marine animal fossil)
stem plates, from near Columbia.</p>
</div>
<p>Pure limestone is composed of 100% calcium carbonate (calcite
mineral), whereas pure dolomite contains 54.35% calcium carbonate
and 45.65% magnesium carbonate (dolomite mineral). Magnesium
carbonate has slightly higher acid-neutralizing properties than calcium
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
carbonate, weight for weight, and because analyses of limestone
to be used for soil sweetening and agricultural fertilizer
purposes are commonly reported in calcium carbonate equivalents, a
dolomite or dolomitic limestone may be reported over 100% calcium
carbonate equivalent. Unless one understands the full meaning of
the report he may be bewildered by a statement of the value over
100%.</p>
<p>The calcium and magnesium which form limestone (or dolomitic
limestone) in the ocean are carried there in solution by the streams
which drain the land. Rain water percolating through the ground
and rocks becomes slightly acidified with carbon dioxide (like the
carbonated water in beverages) and dissolves the calcium and magnesium
from primary igneous rocks like gabbro and basalt which are
weathering, or from preexisting limestones which primitively were
derived from igneous rocks. This calcium and magnesium in solution
are responsible for the hardness of the water. In fact, the hard
water in Missouri springs, wells, and streams is hard because it contains
either or both calcium (&ldquo;lime&rdquo;) and magnesium in solution.</p>
<p>This soluble calcium and magnesium flows on in the stream to
the ocean because of its combination with the dissolved carbon dioxide.
In the shallow parts of the ocean, as on the continental shelves where
the water is less than 600 feet deep, the limestone is deposited in layers
just like the white lime layer deposits on the bottom of the teakettle
in which hard water has been boiled. Chemical processes, temperature
changes, evaporation of the ocean water, and organisms are
responsible for most of the limestone deposition. Extensive limestone
deposition is taking place today off the coast of Florida and around
the tropical islands of the southern Pacific.</p>
<p>The uses of limestone are numerous. It is an excellent building
stone in either the rough, sawn, or dressed state. It is used for
rubble stone, rip-rap, railroad ballast, crushed gravel, and aggregate
in concrete. It is one of the raw materials of Portland cement. Quicklime
and hydrated lime are prepared from limestone which has been
heated to drive off the chemically combined carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Limestone is added as a fluxing material in metallurgical processes.
It is the lowest priced source of alkali in chemical industry.
Pulverized limestone may be used as a filler in paints, putty, paper,
or rubber; and rock wool is made by melting and blowing a limestone
having a suitable chemical composition. Two formations develop
a &ldquo;spongy&rdquo; appearance (&ldquo;sponge rock&rdquo; or &ldquo;sponge limestone&rdquo;) upon
weathering and are utilized abundantly in the eastern part of the
state for rock gardens and for ornamental and decorative stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Many tons of limestone are used each year in Missouri as a soil
fertilizer because it neutralizes acidity, coagulates the clay, furnishes
calcium to the plants by way of the colloidal clay, and frees other
chemical elements so that they become available to the plants. No
doubt rocks other than limestone will be crushed and added to the soil
in the future, but today our attention is focussed chiefly on limestone
and dolomite.</p>
<p>The value of a limestone quarry for agricultural purposes depends
upon availability, amount of overburden, purity of the stone, ease of
crushing, and size of deposit. For instance, a stone of 90% purity,
which is close at hand, will probably be more valuable than one of
98% purity which must be hauled fifteen miles. Bare hillsides or
creek banks where a crusher can be set up to handle the stone without
extra lifting are preferable for quarry sites. Usually the overburden
is less in such an exposed face. Impurities in limestone deposits
may be large chert (flint) nodules which can be hand-sorted out,
sand grains, clay which settled into and onto the stone during its
accumulation, and pyrite (fool&rsquo;s gold) or other minerals of lesser
importance. Clay impurities simply act as useless extra weight which
must be handled. Sand grains, however, are hard, and will abrade
and wear out crushing equipment. Chert and fine-grained silica
likewise are harder than steel and will wear a crusher excessively.
Pure limestone (calcite or dolomite mineral) has a hardness less than
that of steel and will only polish or wear the metal slightly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="396" />
<p class="pcap">Typical, intermittently-operated, farm limestone quarry near North
Kansas City.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>It will probably pay to give some thought to this matter of crushing
when selecting a quarry site for agricultural limestone. The several
beds of stone available should be tested not only for amount, but kinds
of impurities. Samples sent in for testing must be <i>representative</i> of
the rocks under consideration or the analytical results are meaningless.
The writer does not believe this point can be over-emphasized.
Time after time he has seen samples taken of geological deposits for
testing which no more represented the deposits than a bantam rooster
picked out of a chicken pen would represent the egg-laying or weight-production
possibilities of the flock of Plymouth Rock hens.</p>
<p>If five layers or beds of stone are to be properly tested, then five
samples must be taken, <i>one broken from each layer of solid rock in
place</i>. The five layers may have the same color, or look much the same,
but fine grains of sand, hardly visible without magnification, may be
abundant in some layers and not in others. If circumstances do not
permit having five different tests made, but allow only one sample
to be run, then specimens should be taken from all five beds, their sizes
being in proportion to the relative amounts expected to be quarried
from each bed, and all five specimens sent to the analyst, who can
crush and mix them.</p>
<p>A single grab sample taken from loose rock on a hillside, in expectation
that it will represent the rocks inside, depends as much on
luck as betting on the weather next 4th of July, a year hence. The
chemist who analyzes the limestone for calcium can usually report on
the kind of impurity if he will take the time to do it.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><a id="g_CottonRockDolomite">&ldquo;Cotton Rock&rdquo; Limestone</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Cotton rock&rdquo; refers to a white to slightly gray or buff variety
of limestone which has a &ldquo;soft&rdquo;, somewhat chalky and porous appearance
that is suggestive of cotton. Missouri &ldquo;cotton rock&rdquo; is usually
dolomitic. Although the term &ldquo;cotton rock&rdquo; has no standing in
a technical sense, its fairly wide use indicates that the name has descriptive
value.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><b id="g_Marble">Marble</b></h3>
<p>Marble, in a scientific sense, is a metamorphic rock and does not
occur as such in Missouri. However, marble has been used as a name
in commercial trade to refer to a crystalline, fairly pure limestone,
which possesses most of the useful qualities of true marble. In that
sense the &ldquo;marbles&rdquo; quarried near Ozora and Carthage, Missouri, are
very excellent stone. No doubt some recrystallization has occurred in
connection with the faulting in the Ozora region, and this may be
interpreted as mild metamorphism. The Carthage &ldquo;marble&rdquo; is quarried
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
from beds of limestone well developed for structural purposes.
These &ldquo;marbles&rdquo; effervesce in acid, of course, just as described for
limestone.</p>
<p>In this connection it is interesting to note that the polish on
limestone or marble is not durable where exposed to the weather in
the same sense as is the polish on granite. Because limestone and
marble are softer than granite they may be cut and polished at
lower cost, but because of their ease of attack by acid, water, and
abrasion they soon become dull when used as an exterior stone. For
interior decoration they are excellent, of course. Granite contains
hard minerals which happen not to be attacked appreciably by dilute
acids, and therefore it retains a polish for a long time even where
exposed to the weather.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><b id="g_CaveOnyx">Cave Onyx</b> and Deposits</h3>
<p>The stalactites (rock icicles) hanging from cave ceilings, stalagmites
built up from the floors, and other drip stone deposits of
caves are largely calcite, the mineral of limestone. Again, this can
be recognized by the limestone acid test (effervescence, see limestone).
Cave onyx may be banded like agate. It is then commonly called
Mexican onyx. The name travertine has also been applied to such
deposits from water.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><b id="g_Travertine">Travertine</b></h3>
<p>Travertine is a general name for calcium carbonate deposits of
varying size, shape, color, texture, and purity which originate largely
through evaporation of spring or surface water. Its composition
of calcium carbonate, calcite mineral, is easily confirmed by effervescence
in acid, like limestone.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><b id="g_Calcite">Calcite</b></h3>
<p>Calcite (sometimes called &ldquo;tiff&rdquo; locally in south-<i>western</i> Missouri),
the essential mineral in limestone, can be recognized by several
definite characteristics:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. It bubbles, &ldquo;fizzes,&rdquo; or <i>effervesces</i> in dilute acid. See <a href="#Page_11">page 11</a>.</dt>
<dt>2. It is easily scratched with a knife.</dt>
<dt>3. It breaks or cleaves into rhombohedral shapes, of which at least one flat, glistening side is visible on every individual grain in the broken surface of limestone.</dt>
<dt>4. It has a glassy luster on crystal and cleavage faces.</dt>
<dt>5. It crystallizes into six-sided crystal forms, which can be differentiated from quartz (also six-sided) by tests (1) and (2) above.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The one single test of calcite which is most diagnostic, and which
appeals to most persons, is number one above, effervescence of the
solid lump in dilute acid. The bubbles are filled by carbon dioxide
gas which comes from, and is freed from, the calcite by the reaction
of it with the acid. Calcite is calcium carbonate, CaCO&#8323;.</p>

<p class="pcap">A small calcite crystal from the Joplin region.</p>
</div>
<p>Many Missourians have not realized that the ordinary, everyday
limestone (fine to coarse granular), which is so abundant here,
is composed of a mineral&mdash;calcite which makes up the grains. The
strikingly beautiful calcite crystals (displayed in museums) derived
from the calcite crystal caves found in some mines in the Joplin
district are accepted without question as <i>mineral</i> specimens of calcite,
but the idea that all of the commonplace glistening grains in the local
limestone are also mineral grains is a new thought to most persons.
A pure limestone is composed entirely of calcite. Even impure limestones
which contain subordinate amounts of quartz sand, chert,
clay, or iron oxide are in the main also calcite. Dolomite and dolomitic
limestones contain the mineral dolomite.</p>
<p>The mineral of ordinary marble is calcite; dolomite marble contains
dolomite. The cementing material in sandstone and a common
accessory mineral in shale are calcite. It is truly a wide-spread and
abundant mineral. Even the lime deposit in the bottom of the tea-kettle,
the water heater, boiler, or automobile cooling system is calcite,
or aragonite, a twin brother to calcite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The use of calcite in the form of limestone is treated under limestone.
As for the use of large calcite crystals, they are sold as
ornaments and curiosities. Visitors to the Missouri State Fair may
recall the exhibit of a beautiful, reconstructed crystal cave which
was lined with large calcite crystals. Calcite crystals have been
shipped in car-load lots to beautify grottos, notably some in Iowa
and Illinois, and are displayed in almost all prominent museums.</p>
<p>Water-white (clear), optical-quality calcite crystals, which command
a high price, are relatively rare and have not been found in
Missouri.</p>
<p>The optical property of calcite which accounts for its high value
is its ability to separate, or refract, every single ray of light passing
through it into two widely separated, easily distinguishable rays, hence
doubling their number. This is called double refraction, and is
shown by the double image of an object viewed through the calcite.
Instruments which polarize light may contain calcite crystals. The
artificial product, &ldquo;Polaroid&rdquo;, is used for a similar purpose.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c10"><b id="g_Dolomite">Dolomite</b></h3>
<p>Dolomite mineral occurs in Missouri as a constituent of dolomitic
limestone or as a vein and cavity filling in the rocks of the Joplin
mining district and as a lining in cavities in the dolomitic limestones
of the southern and eastern parts of the state.</p>
<p>Dolomite when <i>powdered</i> (by scraping the surface of the specimen,
for dolomite is softer than steel or glass) effervesces freely in
cold dilute hydrochloric (muriatic) acid, but the lump dolomite
effervesces <i>very slowly, if at all</i>. Calcite effervesces freely in the
lump with cold dilute acid. This acid test is the one certain test for
dolomite, and works with the thick-bedded formations as well as
with the showy, crystal-faced material from veins. See <a href="#Page_11">page 11</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Dolomite crystals have a pearly luster and are usually pale pink in
the Joplin district. Their faces are commonly curved but where
broken show glistening to pearly cleavage faces. These properties
assume more significance in mineral determination as one becomes
familiar with mineral collections, but the non-technical person can
rely on the acid test.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="499" />
<p class="pcap">Typical dolomite crystals from Joplin region.</p>
</div>
<p>With the above information in mind, one may proceed with
certainty to identify a layer of dolomite from a quarry or hillside, or
a crystal of it in a hand specimen. First, determine that it is
scratched readily with a knife blade or iron nail. Anything too hard
to be scratched by steel is neither calcite nor dolomite. Second, scrape
a small mound of powder on the lump specimens. Third, apply one
or two drops of cold dilute acid to the lump near the powder and
allow the acid to run into the powder. If the <i>lump</i> effervesces <i>freely</i>
the specimen is <i>calcite</i> mineral or limestone rock. If the <i>lump</i> does
<i>not effervesce freely</i> but the <i>powder does</i>, it is <i>dolomite</i> mineral or
dolomite rock, dolomitic limestone. If neither lump nor powder
effervesce it is neither calcite (ordinary limestone) nor dolomite
(dolomitic limestone). In the latter case, it may be gypsum, barite,
Shale, weathered chert, clay, or fire clay, or other rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The composition of dolomite is calcium-magnesium carbonate,
CaMg(CO&#8323;)&#8322;, and when pure runs about 54&frac12; per cent calcium carbonate
and 45&frac12; per cent magnesium carbonate. However, dolomite
is <i>not a mechanical mixture</i> of the two carbonates; it is a single
crystalline compound wherein the calcium and magnesium are securely
interlocked within the arrangement of the atoms. For that
reason, the extraction of magnesium metal or other magnesium compounds
from dolomite is so difficult and costly that other magnesium
minerals, although not nearly so abundant and accessible to industry
as dolomite, have been processed to obtain the lightweight metal
magnesium.</p>
<p>The thick beds of Missouri dolomitic limestone (and some fairly
pure dolomite) have been used chiefly as agricultural stone for soil
sweetening, for building stone, gravel, and other purposes to which
rough stone is put.</p>

<p class="pcap">Shale bluff at a strip mine near Columbia.</p>
</div>
<p>Shale is a compressed, and layered or laminated clay or mud
rock. Consequently it will return to mud if it is wetted with water
and rubbed. This may serve as a test for shale. It may occur in
thick layers or formations, five, ten to fifty or more feet in thickness,
and it ranges downward to paper-thin partings between beds of
limestone. It is also commonly associated with coal beds. The color
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
of shale varies from light gray to black, or it may be tan, yellow, red,
rust, purplish, or green. It is platy, and these thin plates or laminae,
piled on each other, make up the shale bed.</p>

<p class="pcap">Hand specimen of shale shown in preceding picture. Note the characteristic
thin layering or lamination.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="g_HardShale">Some</a> shales are hard, tough, and strong enough to serve as
temporary mine roofs. Hard shales are sometimes called &ldquo;slate&rdquo;
but this name is technically incorrect. <i>True slate</i> is a metamorphic
rock, composed chiefly of the mineral mica in very fine flakes, and
will resist the action of water (weathering) for a long time. Therefore,
it is a good roofing material for buildings, whereas shale is
composed chiefly of clay minerals, and despite the strength and compactness
of the more &ldquo;slaty&rdquo; varieties soon disintegrates in water.
Missouri &ldquo;slaty&rdquo; shale would not serve as satisfactory roofing material.</p>
<p>The red &ldquo;burned&rdquo; shale found on burned-out coal mine dumps is
called &ldquo;shale&rdquo; locally. It is, of course, shale which has been fired more
or less to the condition of building brick by the hot burning waste
coal. The same original shale could be crushed, molded into brick,
&ldquo;burned&rdquo; in a kiln, and become a satisfactory building brick. The
&ldquo;burned shale&rdquo; of the coal mine dumps is used in many places as a
drive-way covering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soapstone&rdquo; is a name applied by some persons to some soft,
slippery to greasy shales, but this name is incorrect in a technical
sense. True soapstone is a metamorphic rock (shale is sedimentary)
which is composed chiefly of the mineral talc. Soapstone occurs
abundantly in certain parts of the Appalachian Mountains but is exceedingly
sparse in Missouri.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The chief commercial uses of shale are in the manufacture of
common brick, building brick, building tile, drain tile, sewer pipe, Portland
cement, and other ceramic products. Many shale beds and occurrences
are technically suitable for these uses but have no real
commercial value because other necessary factors are lacking. In
order to make brick, tile, or cement there must be sufficient fuel available
at low cost, low-priced bulk transportation of the raw and finished
products, available labor, capital for the erection of a plant, and above
all a large near-by, dependable market for the manufactured product.
The value of a shale deposit, therefore, depends as much upon outside
conditions as upon the properties of the rock (shale) itself.</p>
<p>The shales of Missouri were formed from deposits of mud that
settled out in sea water which in the past covered this state. Fossil
remains of sea-living organisms which are preserved in the shale give
evidence of the marine conditions once existent here. Like the muds
that are accumulating along the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of
Mexico, where the Mississippi River is discharging its load of silt
and clay, so did mud form layers on the bottom of geologically ancient
interior seas. In some cases sand was later washed in and
covered the mud; in other cases limestone-forming material (like off
the coast of Florida today) was deposited on top of the mud. The
weight of the overlying beds and the slow movement which raised
the sea bottom up to land squeezed out the excess water, compressed
and compacted the muds into thin layers, and brought about the
shale rock which is exposed to us today.</p>

black shales; red and yellow clays colored by red and yellow iron

from eroding land and soils just as today our eroding soils contribute
to the formation of more shale now in the long, slow process of
formation.</p>

shown by the subjoined composite analyses of sedimentary rocks taken

<p>Many persons upon learning that average shale, and even &ldquo;clay
dirt,&rdquo; may contain 15% alumina, Al&#8322;O&#8323; (equivalent to almost 8%
metallic aluminum), become thoughtlessly and erroneously enthusiastic
about aluminum ore possibilities on their farms or properties.
The aluminum is there all right, but it is so securely combined with
silica and other elements that the cost of extraction is now greater
than the price of aluminum obtained from less abundant ores. Until
chemists find a method of extraction of the metal from ordinary clay
or shale that can be carried out at considerably less expense than is
now possible, the vast quantities of clay and shale on the earth&rsquo;s
surface must be considered a distant reserve of a prohibitively high
cost aluminum.</p>
<p>Missouri possesses a little bauxitic clay in the southeastern
part of the state but unfortunately does not contain deposits of high
grade bauxite, the chief ore of aluminum, and so does not contribute
to the aluminum production of the United States (see the discussion
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
under <a class="gloss" href="#g_DiasporeClay">DIASPORE CLAY</a>). Arkansas is a leading producer of
bauxite, but the geological conditions present in that bauxite locality
are so different from Missouri geology that little hope is held for
finding bauxite in Missouri, except possibly in the extreme southeastern
part.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><b id="g_FireClay">Fire Clay</b></h3>
<p>Fire clay resembles shale in that it is also a clayey rock and becomes
muddy upon wetting and rubbing. It differs from shale at
sight in that it (fire clay) is not laminated like shale, but occurs
instead in a massive structure which is relatively uniform throughout.
Fire clay fractures naturally into blocky or irregular fragments
ranging in size from boulders to rough flakes, whereas shale weathers
into layered, platy chips.</p>
<p>Shales are commonly buff, yellow, reddish, greenish, or brown in
addition to gray in color, whereas good useable fire clay predominates
in white, cream, and gray to almost black (if much organic matter is
contained in it). Shale is ordinarily gritty with hard sand particles,
but most good Missouri fire clay contains only a small amount of sand.
Of course, fire clay may grade into sandstone through a sandy clay
phase, but this part would not be confused with a layered, gritty
shale.</p>
<p>The really determining characteristic of fire clay is its resistance
to melting under high temperature. The most positive test for this
property is to heat the fire clay to a white heat in comparison with
standard preparations (Pyrometric Test Cones) whose fusion temperatures
are known. Most of Missouri fire clay will withstand a
clean oxidizing heat of over 3000&deg; Fahrenheit without melting.</p>
<p>Clay minerals originate, in general, from the weathering of
previously existing silicate rocks and have therefore been called, on
occasions, &ldquo;rotted rocks.&rdquo; The writer has long insisted that clays,
particularly fire clays, should be thought of instead as purified or refined
rocks. The original silicate rocks and minerals, which were
rich in constituents melting at low temperatures, have been soaked,
leached, and washed by chemically active ground water and rain water
until many of the undesirable elements have been carried away,
leaving a refined material which we use and know as fire clay. Missouri
possesses one of the largest reserves of finest quality fire clay
in the world. Special bulletins on Missouri fire clay are published by
the State Geologist, Rolla, Missouri, and may be obtained from his
office.</p>

<p>Persons who have undeveloped fire clay deposits on their property
frequently ask advice on whom to contact and how to arrange
for sale of their fire clay, with the expectation of a fair return and
fair treatment. The writer recommends in such cases that the owner
of the clay dig into his deposit to obtain a fresh, clean, <i>representative</i>
specimen of his fire clay (about one pound) and send it to one or
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
more of the large substantial fire brick or refractories companies operating
in Missouri. Obviously the company located nearest the
deposit, or with the lowest-cost shipping facilities, will be in a favored
position to purchase the clay. If the individual is skeptical about
the trustworthiness of the company&rsquo;s report, he may send opposite
parts of the sample lumps to competitive companies. Of course, the
individual may have his clay tested by an independent laboratory at
his own expense, but this is ordinarily a useless, costly experience
because a company will duplicate those tests in its own laboratory
before purchasing the clay. If the refractories companies find the
clay useful to them they will proceed with negotiations. If the clay
is of inferior quality or if it is not needed by the particular company
at <i>that time</i>, even though of acceptable quality, usually the company
will return a truthful report at no cost to the clay owner.</p>
<p>The same general advice is given in regard to the development
of any mineral deposit which the holder may have. The caution
about obtaining a representative sample is especially to be emphasized.
It applies to the metallic ores, mineral water, and common rock as
well as to fire clay.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><b id="g_PlasticFireClay">Plastic Fire Clay</b></h3>
<p>Plastic fire clay forms a sticky, soft mass when wetted and
kneaded with water, and will bond together other clays or rocks.
Large plastic fire clay deposits occur in Audrain, Callaway, and St.
Louis counties, and lesser quantities are known in Boone, Osage,
Gasconade, and Phelps counties. The larger deposits assume a blanket
shape with a highly irregular lower surface.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><b id="g_FlintFireClay">Flint Fire Clay</b></h3>
<p>Flint fire clay is very fine-grained, smooth or slick, and breaks
with a shell-like (conchoidal) fracture. It varies in color from white
to black, but most flint fire clay mined is near to white. It is relatively
non-plastic&mdash;that is, does not readily slake or form a sticky
mass when worked a little in water. In fact, flint fire clay has been
used locally as road surfacing because it does not become very muddy
and sticky. Of course, it is inferior to black-top or concrete road surfaces
and has too high a commercial value now to be used extensively
as road metal.</p>
<p>A hard, white variety of flint fire clay which breaks with numerous
conchoidal fractures in appropriate shaped fragments has been
called locally &ldquo;pop-corn flint.&rdquo; This clay, and other sand-free flint
clay, when crushed between one&rsquo;s teeth &ldquo;goes to water&rdquo; in the mouth.
Many clay miners use the chewing test to establish the freedom of
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
their clays from gritty sand, which renders flint clay inferior in
quality.</p>

<h3 id="c15"><b id="g_DiasporeClay">Diaspore Clay</b></h3>
<p><a id="g_Diaspore">Diaspore</a> clay is a harsh, usually porous, earthy type of clay
which has been found in Warren, Osage, Gasconade, Maries, Franklin,
Phelps, and Crawford counties in Missouri. Some diaspore
clay is mealy, or finely granular, some is chalky to compact, and much
of it is more or less oolitic. Oolites (oolitic structure) are small
rounded bodies varying in size from about bird shot to BB shot size,
and those in diaspore may be solid or hollow. Their hollow structure
contributes to the porous condition in diaspore clay. See <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to write a description of diaspore clay
which can be used to determine it because the clay has so few individual
characteristics. A person familiar with diaspore clay, however,
can recognize it at a glance. Probably diaspore clay will not be
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
found outside the counties listed above, and within those counties
many persons know the clay from contact with the commercial production
of it.</p>

<p class="pcap">Diaspore clay, over 70% alumina, from near Belle.</p>
</div>
<p>Diaspore clay occurs in old sink-hole, funnel-shaped pits which
formed in the dolomite (limestone) underlying that region. A sandstone
layer which lines the pit and commonly stands somewhat above
the level of the clay because of the sandstones superior resistance to
weathering is known as the &ldquo;rim rock&rdquo; of the pit. The diaspore
clay may be thought of as an extra-refined type of fire clay from which
silica has been leached during prolonged solution in swamps and
ground water and the more stable alumina (Al&#8322;O&#8323;) left behind as
the refined product.</p>
<p>Pits in the diaspore region may contain from a few truck loads
of clay to over 50,000 tons of it, but a pit which produces 10,000 tons
of good clay is a valuable and not very common deposit. A small
fortune falls to the landowner who finds a large diaspore deposit
(pit) on his farm, for royalty rates at this time are not less than
$1.00 per ton for first grade, 70% Al&#8322;O&#8323; clay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Because of the high value of diaspore, a highly competitive prospecting,
leasing, mining, and brokerage business has developed in
the diaspore region. Practically all of the thrills, hopes, disappointments,
and good fortunes that are associated with oil booms are found
in this business and clay area; clay pits are only smaller in scale than
wild oil gushers. Clay scouts work in secret, mining leases are contested
in court, rumors fly fast in English, German, and German-Swiss
over the country telephones, prospecting results may be hidden,
personal pressure may be brought to influence a deal, and speedy
salesmanship is employed when an exciting find is in the offing. When
the legends, traditions, and facts of the diaspore region are collected
and recorded, an interesting and essential part of Missouri history
will have been written.</p>
<p>Missouri has the only locality in the entire world where relatively
pure diaspore clay is now mined in commercial quantities. Because
of its extreme resistance to fusion under very high temperatures,
diaspore has been called the &ldquo;aristocrat of fire clays.&rdquo; Diaspore contains
a higher percentage of aluminum than does bauxite, the chief
ore of aluminum, but because of diaspore&rsquo;s extremely refractory nature
it is less easily reduced to aluminum metal than is bauxite, and
therefore finds a more specialized use in the manufacture of refractory
and super-refractory brick and tile which may even be used in
furnaces to calcine aluminum ore. Where resistance to very high
temperature has been required, diaspore super fire brick has been
remarkably useful.</p>

As the relative number of diaspore oolites increase, an otherwise flint
clay becomes burley-flint, then typical burley, and finally grades into
second quality and first quality diaspore. Clay in any stage of the
variation may be found in some part of the diaspore region or pits.
Most of the remarks written on diaspore apply as well to burley clay.</p>
<h3 id="c17"><b id="g_Sandstone">Sandstone</b></h3>
<p>Sandstone is a rock made of sand-size particles more or less well
cemented. It is recognized by the grains of sand which are dislodged
or scratched loose when the rock is broken, or when scraped
with a piece of steel or another hard rock. The old-fashioned grindstone
is a sandstone nicely cemented by nature.</p>

</div>
<p>Sandstone occurs in thin layers to thick massive beds and deposits
which may exceed fifty feet in thickness. In addition to
possessing horizontal bedding and parallel bedding planes, some
sandstone displays beautiful, intricate cross-bedding or cross-lamination.</p>
<p>The grains of sand composing the stone may be either angular
or rounded. They may sparkle in the light from reflections from their
crystal faces, or they may have dull, frosted surfaces. Sandstones
are ordinarily nearly white in color except where the grains are
covered with coatings of yellow or red iron oxide (rust).</p>

<p class="pcap">Quartz sand grains. Magnification 21x.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The grains themselves are predominantly particles of the mineral
quartz, although any rock or mineral of sand size may be present
in sandstone. The quartz (see discussion of quartz on <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>)
may have been derived from pre-existing sandstones or more directly
from granite, porphyry, or other igneous rocks in which quartz crystallized
when the hot liquid rock solidified. Today quartz grains which
are weathering out of igneous rocks and sandstones are being carried
by the Missouri river and tributaries to the Mississippi river and
thence to the ocean, where extensive deposits of sand are accumulating,
probably destined to become widespread beds of sandstone.</p>
<p>The grains of sand may be broken and become angular during
their long trip to the ocean, or they may become rounded by rubbing
against each other. If they exist in sand dunes, blown about by the
wind before being cemented into rock, the grains usually become
somewhat rounded. Even after sandstones are buried beneath other
rocks, silica, which is carried in solution by ground waters percolating
through the sandstone, may crystallize out on the sand grains
and restore some brilliant, angular crystal faces to the otherwise
rounded grains.</p>
<p>Cementation of loose sand to more or less firm sandstone is
due to the presence of clay, iron oxides, or calcite (mineral of limestone)
which may be deposited with the sand. All of these cements
are softer and weaker than quartz, thereby being broken first and
freeing the harder quartz when the rock is scratched or crushed.</p>
<p><a id="g_Quartzite">A</a> <a id="g_QuartziticSandstone">variety</a> of very hard sandstone called quartzite is one that is
so strongly cemented that it breaks through the sand grains instead
of around them as is the case with ordinary sandstone. This condition
is brought about by their being cemented with silica (chemically
the same as quartz), which makes for essentially uniform hardness
throughout the rock.</p>
<p>Quartzites are, as previously noted, extremely hard, and resist
abrasion and chemical weathering. Reddish quartzite boulders occur
rather abundantly north of the Missouri River in the glacial clay,
sand, and gravel which overlie the sedimentary rocks that form the
bed rock or country rock there. Locally, the hard, red quartzite
boulders may be called &ldquo;red niggerheads&rdquo;, although the term &ldquo;niggerhead&rdquo;
is more often applied to black or dark greenish black boulders
of basalt (see <a href="#Page_48">page 48</a>) also present in the glacial drift. It is to be
recalled that the distinguishing hardness of quartzite is due to the
hardness of the quartz grains plus the equal hardness of the silica
cement.</p>
<p>Asphaltic sandstone is a sandstone impregnated with a bituminous
residue from the evaporation of petroleum which once occupied
the pores of the rock. It has been reported from more than a dozen
counties in western Missouri, but the most extensive deposits are
probably in Barton, Vernon, and Lafayette counties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Attention has been directed to the origin of sandstones from
ocean deposits of sand and from sand dunes, but it should be recognized
also that river channels and stream valleys which contain deposits
of sand (such as those on floodplains, river bottoms, and sand
bars) may be covered, and the sand consolidated to sandstone. Many
years ago, even long ago geologically, a large river, almost comparable
in size to the Missouri river, occupied a channel which is now represented
by a long narrow sandstone deposit extending from a little
north of Clinton through Warrensburg to Lexington and then east
through Moberly almost to Paris. Smaller channel sandstones are
abundant in other areas in Missouri.</p>
<p>The sandstones of the so-called Roubidoux formation, which occurs
in south central Missouri, commonly show well-preserved ripple
marks on the rock slabs. These marks were formed exactly as their
name suggests&mdash;in sand which was thrown into ripples by the shallow
water in which it accumulated and was covered and cemented so as to
retain the ripple forms.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="457" />
<p class="pcap">Ripple marks in limy sandstone.</p>
</div>
<p>Sandstone is used for building stone, walks, grindstones, furnace
linings, and rock gardens. Large quantities are mined each year near
Pacific, Festus and Crystal City, Klondike, and Hermann, for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
manufacture of glass and other uses. Common glass is a cooled melt
of relatively pure silica sand, soda ash, and lime. Asphaltic sandstone
is used in road building. Sand-lime brick are made of sand.
Sand is used as a molding material for metal castings, a parting substance
between brick in kilns, and in large quantities in concrete and
mortar mixtures.</p>
<h3 id="c18"><b id="g_Chert">Chert</b>, <b id="g_Flint">Flint</b></h3>
<p>The names chert and flint have in some regions been used for
the same hard, fine-grained rock found so abundantly in Missouri, but
correct usage employs chert for the white and gray varieties, and
flint for the black variety. Flint may be thought of as slightly impure
chert, a chert which is colored black by a small amount of pigment,
usually fine carbon, or perhaps iron sulphide, scattered through
it like fine dust.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="416" />
<p class="pcap">Chert, fossiliferous and slightly speckled. Note typical sharp edges,
smooth surfaces, and conchoidal fracture. From near Columbia.</p>
</div>
<p>Chert is characterized by being harder than glass, brittle, very
fine-grained, and by breaking with a smooth, rounded or hollowed
clam shell-like (conchoidal) fracture and sharp edges. It was used
by Indians to make arrow heads. It accumulates in abundance both in
stream beds as gravel which has been more or less rounded by
wear, and on the hillsides within the soil and sub-soil. Yellow and
red iron oxides may stain and penetrate weathered chert gravel so
that it becomes reddish, rusty, tan, yellow or brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Chert remains abundant because of its extreme resistance to
weathering. It is so hard that stream action wears it only very
slowly. Its chemical composition is silica, SiO&#8322;, a substance which is
but little affected chemically by ground water. Where chert has
contained fine grains of calcite scattered through it, the calcite
may be removed in solution, leaving pores, and a zone of porous,
light weight, tripolitic chert, harsh to the feel and enveloping an
unaltered interior (See <a class="gloss" href="#g_WeatheredChert">WEATHERED CHERT</a>). Not uncommonly,
fossil remains of calcite which were embedded in chert have been
dissolved, leaving their hollow impressions.</p>
<p><a id="g_PetrifiedWood">Chert</a> in Missouri originally occurs chiefly in limestone formations,
where it is found as nodules, lenses, stringers, and irregular
forms in and between the limestone beds. Chert and flint may be
deposited directly from silica in solution, or they may replace (substitute
for) wood, fossils, or older rock where silica-bearing solutions
contact and react with the replaced substance. For example, petrified
wood usually is wood which has been replaced molecule by molecule
with silica. This statement applies equally to the brightly colored petrified
wood in the Petrified Forest in Arizona and to that with comparatively
drab coloring in Missouri. Many other siliceous fossils, notably
animal remains, are replacements of calcite (limestone) by silica.</p>
<p>In anticipation that the reader may have difficulty understanding
how silica may go into solution if chert (silica) is hardly attacked by
the weathering process, it should be explained that silica is freed in
solution predominately during the weathering of complex silica-combinations,
silicates, rather than from uncombined silica. For
instance, feldspar and pyroxene from granite or gabbro weather in
ground water to a soil-forming clay mineral and release some silica
in solution in the ground water. After this silica is redeposited in
an uncombined form, like chert, it becomes highly insoluble.</p>
<p>An observation in regard to flint is that the metallic &ldquo;flints&rdquo; which
are used to ignite gas burners or cigarette lighters are not black
chert, SiO&#8322;. Instead, they are special alloys containing rather uncommon
elements which possess the useful characteristic of emitting a
brilliant hot spark when harshly scratched.</p>
<p>Chert is the chief source of natural gravel in Missouri because it
accumulates in stream beds and on hillsides on account of its resistance
to weathering. The piles of &ldquo;chats&rdquo; in the Joplin region,
containing thousands of tons of crushed chert, have been used in
part in road surfacing material.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h3 id="c19"><b id="g_WeatheredChert">Weathered Chert</b></h3>
<p>Weathered chert, or leached chert, is a white to gray, or yellowish,
porous, light-weight, harsh to feel, chalky-appearing rock which occurs
over much of the southern half of Missouri. It does not effervesce
in acid. Usually it occurs as a zone from a fraction of, to more than
an inch in thickness, about a denser core of hard, compact chert
(flint), or makes up an entire small rock fragment or gravel.</p>

</div>
<p>It develops as a relatively insoluble residue left when the
more soluble rock material in association has been leached away during
the weathering process. Its composition approaches pure silica.
It has no established use and no commercial value.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c20"><b id="g_Kaoleen">&ldquo;Kaoleen&rdquo;</b></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Kaoleen&rdquo; is a term used locally in part of south-central Missouri
to refer to a chalky, white to tan or buff, porous weathered chert, but
the name should be dropped because it is unnecessary (use weathered
chert), confusing, and not recognized elsewhere. Most probably the
term arose in corruption of the word <i>kaolin</i>, which is the name for a
true, high-quality clay, to which the leached and weathered chert bears
a slight resemblance. Kaolin has the chemical composition of clay
(hydrous aluminum silicate), whereas &ldquo;kaoleen&rdquo; is impure silica.
See the discussion on <a class="gloss" href="#g_WeatheredChert">Weathered Chert</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c21"><b id="g_Tripoli">Tripoli</b></h3>
<p>Tripoli occurs in the vicinity of Seneca, Newton County, Missouri.
It is a light-weight, porous, white to creamy, siliceous rock,
which may be scratched because of its softness. Tripoli represents
the porous insoluble residue of an earlier rock, which was composed of
skeletal insoluble silica and interstitial soluble calcium carbonate
(calcite), the latter having been dissolved away by ground water.
Tripoli has a chalky appearance but is totally unlike chalk chemically.
Tripoli is nearly pure silica, whereas chalk is calcium carbonate. Any
tripoli-like rock found in Missouri outside the region of tripoli mines
is likely to be a fragment of weathered chert which is described above.</p>
<p>Tripoli has been used as an abrasive, a polishing agent, a parting
material in molding sand, and a filter rock.</p>
<h3 id="c22"><b id="g_Agate">Agate</b></h3>
<p>Agate is a banded variety of chert. Although the chemical composition
of agate is SiO&#8322;, the same as chert, a microscopically fibrous
part of it having a waxy luster or varying in color or translucency
may give the appearance to the rock that we associate with the name
agate. The mineral name chalcedony is given to the fibrous, waxy
material.</p>
<p>Typical agates are most abundant in Missouri in the glacial and
stream gravels in the northern part of the state, although part of the
Potosi drusy quartz and chalcedony in the southeast is also prized.
The large gravel pit near LaGrange, in the northeast, has furnished
many beautiful specimens, not only of agate, but also of petrified
wood and fossils.</p>
<p>Missouri lapidists and collectors of semi-precious stones find
plenty of interesting raw material within their own state.</p>

<p>Granite is a granular (coarse-grained) rock which has a glassy
luster and is too hard to be scratched appreciably by steel. It may
be white to gray, tan, brown, or pink to red in color, but pinkish to
red granite predominates in Missouri. Some black stone, referred
to locally as &ldquo;black granite,&rdquo; is usually a variety of gabbro. Most
Missouri granite is coarse-grained, so that the constituent mineral
grains&mdash;quartz, feldspar, and (less frequently) mica&mdash;can be readily
recognized by anyone familiar with those minerals. It makes up many
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
of the mountains and hills in Iron, Madison, and St. Francois counties
and adjacent regions. North of the Missouri River, or where the
glacial deposits remain, granite boulders may occur in the sandy and
clayey glacial drift.</p>
<p>The mineral quartz is recognized in granite by its glistening,
oily luster, really more brilliant than the luster of glass, and by its
curved to irregular broken surface. Furthermore, the brilliant luster
of quartz is not dulled by exposure to weather.</p>
<p>The mineral feldspar, in granite, has a glassy luster on the tiny
flat cleavage faces where the individual grains are broken. Where
weathered, feldspar becomes dulled, and chalky to dusty or clayey.
Fresh feldspar may be glassy, white, buff, pink, red, in intermediate
shades in color. With the mica, it imparts most of the color to granite.</p>
<p>Mica is recognized by its softness and its ability to be split very
easily into tiny flakes. Other minerals may be found in granite
under the microscope, but they have little importance or significance.</p>

</div>
<p>Granite is an intrusive igneous rock; that is, it solidified from a
hot liquid state (like lava) in a large body, beneath, or surrounded by
pre-existing rocks. Because of slow solidification a coarse-grained
texture was developed. In southeastern Missouri where granite is
now exposed at the surface (for example, the Elephant Rocks State
Park at Graniteville), that granite was covered originally by hundreds
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
of feet of rock at the time it solidified from a liquid. During
the millions of years which have elapsed since the granite solidified,
its cover and the upper part of the granite have been eroded away
by streams and rain after weathering to soil material. In fact, the
ocean has covered the area several times during its long geological
history.</p>
<p>Missouri has a fine quality of granite in large quantity in southeastern
Missouri. Granite is used for building, structural and monument
purposes (see discussion under <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marble">marble</a>), for rubble stone, rip-rap,
ballast, gravel, paving blocks, crushed chicken gravel, and for
other specialized uses where favorably located. Chemical analyses of
granite and porphry, taken from Missouri Geological Survey Report,
Volume VIII, 1895, follow.</p>

<p>The glacial granite boulders found in central to northern Missouri
also solidified as intrusive rock in the northern United States
or in Canada. After being exposed at the surface they were picked
up and carried down by the geologically recent, continental ice sheet
(glacier) that moved down from Canada to across the northern half
of Missouri. Scratches and grooves may have been cut in some of
these boulders, or flat faces scoured and planed off as they were
scraped against other hard rocks. Quartz gravel is usually present,
often in abundance, in glacial deposits. Small specimens of native
metallic copper, which come from near Lake Superior, have been
found in Missouri glacial deposits. Even diamonds from an unknown
source in the north were carried by the ice down into the United
States. The history of the glaciation is a spectacular account of
changes which our continent has undergone in the geological past.</p>

<h3 id="c25"><b id="g_Quartz">Quartz</b></h3>
<p>Quartz is a mineral of wide-spread occurrence which is characterized
by the following properties: (1) it is considerably harder
than glass or steel, (2) it has a high luster, glassy to oily, (3) it
breaks with an irregular or rough glistening fracture, and (4) it
crystallizes in six-sided crystals when it grows unobstructed. Ordinary
acids do not attack quartz, and it is relatively unaffected by
chemical weathering in Missouri. Its composition is silicon dioxide,
SiO&#8322;.</p>
<p>Quartz occurs in granite as the lustrous, partially rounded grains
which constitute perhaps 20% of the rock (feldspar makes up most
of the more opaque remainder which breaks with many small flat
faces), and is recognized in the small glistening grains in the
porphyry. Hence it is an important igneous rock-forming mineral.</p>
<p>Sandstone in Missouri is made almost entirely of quartz grains
which have been broken, worn, and more or less rounded during their
long travel history. The sandstone formation quarried and mined
near Pacific and Crystal City, named the St. Peter sandstone formation,
is an outstandingly pure quartz sandstone and therefore usable
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in the glass industry. It is obvious that quartz is an important constituent
of sedimentary rocks.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="676" />
<p class="pcap">Lustrous, translucent quartz. The irregular fracture and oily luster are
characteristic.</p>
</div>
<p>Further, in the sedimentary dolomite formation near Potosi, fine
to coarse quartz crystals line the surfaces of cavities and pockets in
the stone. This cavity coating of quartz which reflects light brilliantly
from the many small crystal faces is called drusy quartz by the
mineralogist, but is locally and popularly known as &ldquo;blossom rock.&rdquo;
Thousands of pounds of &ldquo;blossom rock&rdquo; are sold each year for rock
gardens and various ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>In northeastern Missouri quartz crystals line the hollow, more or
less spherical bodies called Geodes, which vary in size from small
nuts to melons, and weather out of the so-called Warsaw formation.
Other types of hollow cavities in many Missouri rocks may contain
quartz growing inward from their walls.</p>
<p>Missouri chert is composed primarily of quartz in microscopically
fine grains; likewise, agate and petrified wood may contain abundant
quartz. Other varieties are rock crystal, rose quartz, amethyst, false
topaz, bloodstone, carnelian, and onyx.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Quartz crystallized in an igneous rock as the hot fluid cooled
through its &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; temperature interval, which was probably not
below 1000&deg;F. In the cases of the quartz in geodes, the drusy quartz,
or that in cavities within petrified wood, quartz crystals grew from
ground water solutions which must have carried very low concentrations
of silica in solution, and whose temperatures did not depart far
from that of rocks buried at various depths today. Although quartz
is a very common and abundant mineral, our specific knowledge about
its transport and deposition is surprisingly meager.</p>

</div>
<p>Quartz crystals are used in large quantities in radio apparatus
where it is necessary to maintain very close control on the tuning of
a circuit. This use requires quartz of highest quality and crystals
above minimum size, which have never been found in Missouri and
probably are not present. Silica production from this state is in its
sandstone, tripoli, chert chats, and rock garden ornamental stone.</p>
<h3 id="c26"><b id="g_Feldspar">Feldspar</b></h3>
<p>Feldspar is a white to pink or red mineral having a glassy luster
on its flat broken surfaces (cleavage faces). It will scratch window
glass.</p>
<p>It is the most abundant mineral in granite and usually controls
the color of that rock; for example, the red granite at Graniteville contains
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
red feldspar, and the pink-gray granite in the Knoblick region
has feldspar of those colors. Small bodies or bands of very coarse
feldspar, quartz, and mica (pegmatite dikes) which cut the granite
may contain crystals of feldspar large enough to be recovered as
small, hand specimens, but otherwise it does not occur in coarse fragments.
The recognizable crystals, or phenocrysts, in the porphyry
are mainly feldspar.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="284" />
<p class="pcap">A large piece of feldspar showing cleavage surfaces.</p>
</div>
<p>Feldspar is really a family name for a group of several minerals,
all of which are crystallized in the igneous rocks. The potassium
(potash)-containing varieties, named <a id="g_OrthoclaseFeldspar">orthoclase</a>
and <a id="g_MicroclineFeldspar">microcline</a>, occur
in the granite and porphyry, whereas plagioclase, a calcium-sodium
(lime-soda) feldspar is in gabbro, diabase, and basalt.</p>
<p><a id="g_PlagioclaseFeldspar">Plagioclase</a> commonly has a thin, lath shape, is a shade of gray,
and makes up the lighter colored part of the greenish to dark gray
igneous rocks. Further differences between it and orthoclase may
interest the mineralogist but are of little concern to the non-technical
person.</p>
<p>Pulverized feldspars are used extensively in the ceramic industries,
but Missouri does not have any productive deposits. Under
natural, long-time weathering processes feldspar usually decomposes
to clay which may be used technically, but the usual fate of it is soil
formation.</p>
<h3 id="c27"><b id="g_Mica">Mica</b></h3>
<p>Mica, incorrectly called isinglass, is an elastic, fairly soft, platy
mineral, which may be split into flakes of paper thinness. The relatively
clear variety is called muscovite, and the brownish black to
black variety is biotite, both being members of the mica family. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
may occur in Missouri in small grains in the igneous rocks, except
that muscovite may be present in sandstone, where it was deposited
along with the quartz sand.</p>
<p>Mica is used chiefly as insulating material in the electrical industry
where large sheets are required. Another use is as window
or chimney material in stoves or lanterns. Missouri has no mica
which is satisfactory for these purposes.</p>

<p>Porphyry and granite are the two most abundant igneous rocks

and adjacent country). The porphyry there is a compact, very fine-grained,
almost glassy, hard, brittle rock that varies in color from
light gray through pink and red to dark purplish red and almost
black. It always breaks with a horny, flinty fracture. Small mineral
crystals of glistening quartz and usually reddish feldspar are generally
scattered throughout the dense background (groundmass). The crystals
are commonly about one-sixteenth of an inch in cross section
and ordinarily constitute from about ten to twenty per cent of the
rock. Other names, somewhat more specific than simple porphyry,
which are applied technically to certain phases of the rock are rhyolite,
and rhyolite porphyry.</p>

the main poured out as lava flows, millions of years ago. Volcanic
dust or &ldquo;ash&rdquo; was erupted during the same period, and layers of it,
now strongly cemented, are found in association with the flow rock.</p>
<p>The Missouri rhyolite porphyry has about the same chemical
composition (see <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>) as Missouri granite, but whereas granite
is coarse-grained, the porphyry has an extremely fine-grained to almost
glassy ground-mass. This difference in texture (grain size) is
due to the difference in rate of solidification. The porphyry lava flows
chilled and solidified very rapidly, thereby freezing the liquid to
glassy and extremely fine-grained rock, except for the scattered
larger crystals (phenocrysts) which had developed prior to eruption.
Granite, on the other hand, solidified very slowly under a thick cover
of rock which acted as a heat insulator, and during the long time
of solidification large or coarse grains of minerals could grow and
develop by crystallization so that a coarse-textured rock (granite)
was formed.</p>
<p>The relative ages of the Missouri igneous rocks are of interest to
geologists and to most persons who recognize the different types within
a small area. It has been found that the prophyry was invaded by the
granitic liquid, that both the porphyry and granite were cracked
after solidification, and that liquid basalt rose and filled the cracks.
Hence the porphyry is the oldest, the granite next in age, and the
basalt is youngest. In fact, it may be mentioned in passing that some
basalt and allied dikes have been found cutting through the sedimentary
sandstone, shale, and limestone which overlie the igneous
granite and porphyry and are much younger.</p>
<p>Missouri porphyry has little use or value other than of bulk or
crushed stone.</p>
<h3 id="c29"><b id="g_Basalt">Basalt</b></h3>
<p>Basalt is a fine-grained, dark-gray, dark-green, or greenish-black
rock which is hard enough to be scratched with difficulty by steel.
It originated by the solidification of lava. Today, basalt rock is
forming where lava at the Hawaiian volcanoes solidifies.</p>
<p>The relatively small amount of basalt in southeastern Missouri
solidified mostly in cracks within other rocks through which it rose.
Those occurrences&mdash;that is, fillings in nearly vertical cracks&mdash;are
called dikes. The basalt dikes in southeastern Missouri have been
exposed by the weathering and erosion of rocks which previously covered
them.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>In northern Missouri, boulders of basalt may be found in deposits
of glacial clay, sand, and gravel (glacial drift), where they were
left after the melting of the great ice sheet which brought the basalt
down from ancient dikes and igneous bodies cropping out in the
northern United States and Canada. Many of the boulders have
been rounded by weathering, and their shape, together with their
dark color, has stimulated the local name &ldquo;niggerhead&rdquo; for them.</p>

<p class="pcap">Basalt in hand specimen.</p>
</div>
<p>Basalt is a strong, tough, well-knit rock that will withstand heavy
blows from a sledge hammer, which usually rebounds upon striking.
Except for use as rubble stones, basalt has no commercial value. It
weathers characteristically to a yellowish, brownish, or reddish surface
coating of iron oxide and clay.</p>
<h3 id="c30"><b id="g_Gabbro">Gabbro</b> and <b id="g_Diabase">Diabase</b></h3>
<p>Gabbro and Diabase are dark-colored, coarse-grained, hard igneous
rocks, which may be found in the granite and porphyry regions
of southeastern Missouri and as separate boulders in the glacial deposits
north of the Missouri River. Both resemble basalt, which has
been described in detail elsewhere, except that basalt is fine-grained,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
whereas gabbro and diabase are coarse-grained (separate grains
easily distinguished without a magnifying glass). The layman is
ordinarily not concerned with the technical differences between gabbro
and diabase, which appear about the same. Both contain plagioclase
feldspar (see <a class="gloss" href="#g_Feldspar">FELDSPAR</a>) and a dark green mineral of the pyroxene
family.</p>

<p>Gabbro and Diabase are sometimes called &ldquo;black granite.&rdquo; Their
chief use is as bulk or rubble-stone, although special varieties may
be used for building purposes.</p>
<h3 id="c31"><b id="g_Coal">Coal</b></h3>
<p>Coal is so well known that little need be written about its distinguishing
characteristics. Most of the coal in Missouri is of about
bituminous rank, although some cannel coal, which is discussed
below, is also present.</p>
<p>Missouri bituminous coal occurs in the northern and western
parts of the state. It contains bands of dull coal, bands of glistening
&ldquo;glance&rdquo; coal, the sooty &ldquo;mineral charcoal,&rdquo; and common mineral
impurities like calcite, gypsum, pyrite and marcasite (&ldquo;sulphur&rdquo;), clay
minerals, and quartz. Bituminous coal breaks with essentially a
cubical fracture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It occurs in horizontal or nearly horizontal beds or &ldquo;seams,&rdquo;
which may be followed considerable distances laterally without necessarily
encountering much change. Usually, a fire clay or a fire clay-like
under-clay immediately underlies the coal, but the overlying rock
(the roof) may be shale (slate? see discussion of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shale">SHALE</a>), sandstone,
or less commonly, limestone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="346" />
<p class="pcap">Bed of coal exposed by stream erosion, near Columbia.</p>
</div>
<p>Coal originates from pre-existing plants and may be thought of
as Mother Nature&rsquo;s storage cellar of &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; plant life. The
Missouri coal began millions of years ago as mosses, tree-like ferns,
conifers, and various plants that reproduce by spores, which flourished
in great wide-spread swamps. Insects were abundant, as is
indicated by their remains. Rain was probably plentiful and climate
favorable, so that such vegetation thrived luxuriantly. Today, fallen
forest timber of the highland disappears by oxidizing and decaying
in the air; but in swamp land the leaves, stems, pollen and woody
trunks fall into and under water and under favorable conditions decompose
through bacterial and chemical action into layers and pools
of slippery, oozy, blackish humic gel (like brownish black gelatin,
&ldquo;jello&rdquo;), which remains. Likewise, in ages past, more and more
plant material continued to live, fall, and accumulate in the old coal
swamps until very thick deposits of the woody gel existed.</p>
<p>Eventually land-sea or climatic conditions changed, and plant
life died out as mud, sand, or other rock-forming material was swept
in to cover, as a lid, the stored-up plant remains. The weight of
overlying beds squeezed out excess water from the woody gel, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
from the time of covering through the present day, gases (like mine
gases), and other volatile constituents of the coal have been given off.</p>
<p>A bed of coal, which consists chiefly of black combustible carbon,
with volatile constituents and non-volatile ash substances, has resulted.
Man uses the coal by burning it directly, or it may be coked
and the volatile constituents recovered in coal tar and other compounds.
The mineral impurities like the calcite, gypsum, clay, sand,
and brassy pyrite or marcasite, are shaken through the grates as
ash or melted as clinkers.</p>
<p>In nature, the pyrite and marcasite minerals may oxidize in
ground water percolating over them to form dilute sulphuric acid,
the acid mine waters.</p>
<p>Cannel coal in Missouri has been found chiefly in old sinkhole
deposits through part of central Missouri. It is characterized
by fracturing conchoidally and having a more massive structure (instead
of the layered structure common to bituminous coal). Cannel
coal burns to a very hot, rather quick fire because of high volatile
content, and is thought to have developed from accumulations very rich
in plant spores.</p>
<p>Coal mining is an important industry in Missouri, and a special
bulletin on coal has been published by the State Geological Survey at
Rolla, Missouri.</p>
<h3 id="c32"><b id="g_Pyrite">Pyrite</b> and <b id="g_Marcasite">Marcasite</b></h3>
<p>Pyrite and Marcasite (Fool&rsquo;s gold, &ldquo;sulphur&rdquo;) are brassy yellow,
metallic, heavy minerals which will scratch glass but which cannot
themselves be scratched by a knife, and which will leave a dark-greenish
to black mark or streak when rubbed across unglazed porcelain
or chert rock. Both are composed of iron sulphide, FeS&#8322;&mdash;iron 46.6 per
cent, and sulphur 53.4 per cent. Although they have the same chemical
composition, they differ in internal atomic and crystalline structure,
which is of interest to scientific mineralogists. Pyrite may
crystallize in cubes, or in forms called pyritohedrons, named from
pyrite, whereas marcasite crystallizes in characteristic arrow-shaped
or cockscomb forms. Marcasite weathers a little more readily than
does pyrite, but otherwise they are much the same to the casual observer.</p>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite have been called &ldquo;fool&rsquo;s gold&rdquo; because so
many persons have been fooled, sometimes with serious financial
consequences, by their slight resemblance to true gold. True gold
is soft, usually slightly orange-yellow in color, malleable, and unaffected
by ordinary acids; and it leaves a gold-colored streak when
rubbed on unglazed porcelain or a hard white rock. Pyrite, in contrast,
is quite hard (harder than steel), is brassy yellow with perhaps
a slight greenish tinge except where tarnished, is brittle, is corroded
by acids or oxidizing ground waters, and leaves a greenish black to
black streak on a white rock. One readily notices the difference in
color between pyrite and gold (such as is in a piece of good quality
jewelry), when the two are viewed close together. Yellowish, partially
weathered mica has also been mistaken for gold.</p>

<p class="pcap">Pyrite in crystal cubes, and replacement of fossils.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite occur abundantly in most of the metal-mining
districts of Missouri, as the &ldquo;brass,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sulphur balls,&rdquo; etc.,
in coal, as small nodules or pellets in some limestone, shale and
sandstone, as replacements of fossils, and as minute crystals in
granite, porphyry, and the other igneous rocks. Several marcasite
mines have been developed in old sinkhole deposits in south central
Missouri, but these are not in production at the time of this writing.
The sinkhole iron mines of south central Missouri contained pyrite-marcasite
before oxidation to the iron oxide ore, and some of them
still contain the sulphides in their lower levels.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p23b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="529" />
<p class="pcap">Marcasite crystal cluster from Joplin region. The arrowhead or cockscomb
crystal form is characteristic of marcasite.</p>
</div>
<p>Marcasite weathers (oxidizes) very readily under most conditions,
with the formation of (1) yellowish brown iron oxide, the
mineral limonite, which may stain rocks, soil, stream bank, etc., and
(2) weak sulphuric acid water. The sulphuric acid solution may
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
react with more marcasite or pyrite and evolve a gas, hydrogen sulphide,
H&#8322;S, which has a rotten-egg odor. This explains the foul
odor often noticed around old coal mine dumps. Heat is evolved in
these reactions, and coal waste on the dump may be ignited by the
heat of the chemical reactions. The burning pyrite, or elemental
sulphur, gives off sulphur dioxide, &ldquo;burning sulphur fumes,&rdquo; which
add to the odor and heat around a coal mine dump. The burning coal
waste and the chemical reactions may raise the temperature of the
coal waste pile high enough to fire or &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the shale rock to a
red, partially vitrified, natural brick-like material, which is sold or
distributed as &ldquo;coal dump shale&rdquo; or &ldquo;burned shale,&rdquo; or &ldquo;red shale&rdquo;
for all-weather surfacing of drives or walks.</p>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite have been used in the commercial manufacture
of sulphuric acid, but elemental sulphur can now be utilized
more economically, so that now no market exists for pyrite or marcasite
in Missouri. In earlier times only large deposits containing thousands
of tons of the mineral had any value. In some foreign countries
pyrite is burned and the fumes utilized for the manufacture of sulphuric
acid, while the cinder, an iron oxide and iron ore, is smelted
to recover metallic iron.</p>
<p>The origin of pyrite and marcasite is as variable as its enclosing
rock. No general statement can be made which will include the
igneous rock pyrite, the Joplin marcasite, the &ldquo;sulphur&rdquo; of the coal,
and occurrences in sink holes and various sedimentary rocks. A discussion
of all these origins alone would fill a pamphlet as large as
this one on Missouri rocks.</p>
<h3 id="c33"><b id="g_Conglomerate">Conglomerate</b></h3>
<p>Conglomerate is a rock composed of gravel, pebbles, and boulders
cemented together, with more or less sand and clay between the
larger fragments. It is truly a conglomeration of rock fragments as
one would find loose today in a stream or ocean shore gravel bar,
or in a hillside gravel bank. Probably the conglomerate most abundantly
exposed in Missouri is that overlying the igneous rocks in the
southeast part of the state.</p>
<h3 id="c34"><b id="g_Gneiss">Gneiss</b></h3>
<p>Gneiss is a hard, granular rock which exhibits a coarsely banded
structure (resulting from metamorphism). The bands are evident
because of color differences due to different mineral content; those
dark in color are commonly rich in dark mica (biotite) or hornblende
(a dark green to black, hard mineral), whereas the light bands
contain feldspar and quartz. Many gneisses have about the same
mineral composition as granite; hence, for our nontechnical purposes,
a banded rock, otherwise granite-like, is a gneiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="493" />
<p class="pcap">Gneiss typically banded.</p>
</div>
<p>Gneiss is a metamorphic rock, a <i>changed</i> rock. The banded
structure was developed by a combination of very high pressure,
high temperature, and solutions acting on a previously existing rock
in essentially a solid condition. The original rock may have been an
igneous or sedimentary rock which has been crushed or made to flow
into bands, or has been re-crystallized. The tremendous pressure which
operated during the banding of most gneisses also crumpled square
miles of rock thousands of feet thick into folded and broken (faulted)
mountains. True slates, marbles, and some quartzites are formed
from soft shales, limestones, and sandstones, respectively, in the
metamorphic process.</p>
<p>Almost no metamorphic rock of this regional type crops out in
Missouri, but the boulders of gneiss which are found in the glacial
deposits were picked up in Canada or the northern United States and
carried to Missouri by a continental glacier thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Except for use as bulk stone or possible structural purposes the
gneiss in Missouri has no value. The glistening yellowish mica sometimes
seen in gneiss is not gold, of course, and is likewise valueless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h3 id="c35"><b id="g_Hematite">Hematite</b></h3>
<p>Hematite (&ldquo;keel&rdquo;) is a heavy, red to purplish red, dull to glistening
mineral which leaves a red mark or streak when rubbed on
a hard white rock (like chert) or on unglazed porcelain. This
red color of hematite coating or stain is responsible for our red
clays, red soils, red iron rust, reddish creek-water, and almost
every bit of natural, red mineral matter in Missouri. Hematite is iron
oxide, Fe&#8322;O&#8323;, and has a close associate, limonite, which is yellow to
brown in color, and has the chemical composition Fe&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;nH&#8322;O. The
two are mentioned together here because they are commonly associated
in nature, where they can be recognized in mixture by the
yellowish red or reddish brown colors on rocks or soils. Individual
discussion is given limonite under its heading, but its relationship to
hematite is repeated here for obvious reasons.</p>

<p class="pcap">Hematite makes a deep red mark or

</div>
<p>Hematite varies in hardness enough that some specimens can
be scratched easily with iron, whereas others are almost as hard as
that metal itself. Where clay occurs mixed with hematite, as in paint
ore, it may be quite soft, but &ldquo;blue kidney ore&rdquo; is usually hard.</p>
<p>Hematite is the ore (iron ore) mineral at Iron Mountain and
Pilot Knob mining districts and in the various sink-hole mines or
pits in south central Missouri. Scattered boulders of hematite occur
in non-commercial quantities within a shaly layer (lower part of
Pennsylvanian age rocks) which crops out extensively in central Missouri,
and the finding of these boulders has at times, unfortunately,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
stimulated short-lived hopes of locating a valuable deposit of iron
ore. Flaming red soil or mountains of red solid rock (as are present
in western United States) may be colored by less than five per cent
iron oxide and are in no sense iron ore because the iron is not
concentrated. Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the
earth&rsquo;s crust, but workable iron mines and deposits are few and far
between. To be commercially valuable an iron ore deposit must
contain tens of thousands of tons and be relatively free from impurities,
notably sulphur and phosphorus. Hence, not many Missouri
farms are locations of iron ore deposits.</p>
<p>The origin of Missouri hematite is about as diverse as its occurrences.
Hot iron-rich solutions coming from an igneous source
below are believed to have introduced the hematite in the Iron Mountain-Pilot
Knob area, but the sink-hole hematite resulted from the
oxidation of iron sulphide. Weathering of older iron-containing
rocks and minerals gave rise to the coloring hematite seen on our
sub-soil and surface rock.</p>
<p>Hematite is used as a polishing agent, as a pigment in paint, and,
of course, as an ore of metallic iron. In the smelting of iron from
hematite the ore is mixed in a huge, chimney-shaped blast furnace
with coke (from coal) and limestone. Air is blown into the furnace
as into a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge; and the coke and gasses, burning at an
incandescent heat, take the oxygen from the Fe&#8322;O&#8323;, leaving metallic
iron which melts and is run out of the furnace at periodic intervals.
Thus the smelting process is the opposite of the rusting process. The
impurities and cinder run out as molten slag.</p>

</div>
<p>Limonite is a heavy, yellow to brown, or brownish black mineral
which always leaves a yellow to brown mark or streak when rubbed
across a hard white rock or unglazed porcelain. It usually has a
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
dull luster on a broken surface, and may vary from thumb-nail hardness
to almost that of steel. The distinguishing test is its yellow to
brown streak.</p>
<p>In composition limonite is iron oxide which contains more or
less water chemically combined, Fe&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;nH&#8322;O. That is, it may be
dried bone-dry at the temperature of boiling water, but upon heating
to redness the additional, chemically held water will be driven off.</p>
<p>Limonite is ordinarily formed from the weathering of other
iron-containing minerals (pyrite, for example) and is therefore a
wide-spread mineral in surface rock, in films on pools of water, and
in soil, all of which it colors yellow to brown. In fact, almost all
of the yellow to brown inorganic mineral color and stain seen in nature
is that of limonite.</p>
<p>Commercial deposits of limonite occur in southeastern Missouri
where large boulders, discontinuous and irregular lenses or beds,
pipes, nodules, and gravel to clay-sized particles of the mineral are
associated with the cherty, gravelly residual clay. Usually the ore
is crushed, hand-sorted, and washed preparatory to concentration
for shipment to a furnace or for use in cement manufacture. As in
the case of hematite, unless one has a deposit amounting to thousands
of tons of ore it has little commercial value, and unless the mineral is
relatively pure it can not be used.</p>

<h3 id="c39"><b id="g_ManganeseOre">Manganese Ore</b></h3>
<p>Several manganese minerals make up the manganese ore which

Reynolds, Carter, Iron, and Madison counties. Although the

and have a black or brownish-black mark or streak, the identification
of the individual minerals is difficult and should be left to a technically
trained mineralogist.</p>

<h3 id="c40"><b id="g_Galena">Galena</b></h3>
<p>Galena (&ldquo;lead&rdquo;) is a heavy, soft, somewhat brittle ore of lead.
It has a brilliant metallic luster, and silvery gray color on a freshly
broken surface. Where weathered it appears dull gray. It can be
scratched with a knife, and breaks with surfaces at 90&deg;, forming
cubes. The unbroken, original crystal form of galena which has
grown unobstructed in a vein opening is commonly cubical in habit
or a modification thereof. It leaves a dark, lead-gray to black mark
or streak when rubbed across unglazed porcelain or chert.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cluster of galena crystals from Joplin region.</p>
</div>
<p>Galena is lead sulphide, PbS, and when pure contains 86.6 per
cent lead and 13.4 per cent sulphur. Small amounts of silver may
also be present.</p>
<p>Galena commonly occurs in Missouri as a cavity filling in crushed
limestone or chert, or as a replacement in limestone or dolomite, or
in shale, so that a large quantity of practically worthless enclosing
rock (gangue) must be taken out in order to obtain the desired galena.
If a person desires to estimate the value of his galena (lead) prospect
by having an analysis or assay made of his ore, he must include in
his sample the gangue rock that would of necessity have to be taken
out when mining his ore. Too often persons carefully select for analysis
a choice galena specimen which may run over 80% lead, only to
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
find that as a practical mine product it would be reduced to less than
5% lead in all the rock which also would have to be taken out.</p>
<p>After a galena ore is mined it is customarily crushed and the
galena removed from the gangue by a gravity-separation process which
takes advantage of the difference in &ldquo;heaviness&rdquo; (specific gravity)
between galena (7.5) and limestone (calcite) or chert (2.7-2.6), or
by a froth flotation process in which the galena is preferentially
wetted and carried off by an oily froth or foam. The galena concentrate
is roasted to burn out the sulphur, reduced by carbon, and smelted
to metallic lead. The origin of some Missouri lead deposits is debatable,
but the writer believes the most reasonable explanation to
be that warm, chemically active waters arose from an igneous body
below and carried to the place of deposition the lead which they held
in solution.</p>
<p>Missouri is one of the leading producers of lead in the world
from its Flat River, Fredericktown, Joplin, and central Missouri
districts, from which in 1941 lead concentrates having a value of
over $15,000,000 were produced.</p>
<h3 id="c41"><b id="g_Sphalerite">Sphalerite</b></h3>
<p>Sphalerite (locally called Jack, Rosin Jack, Black Jack, Ruby
Jack, Zinc, Rosin Spar) is a tan-brown, resinous, brown or brownish
black mineral having a very high luster on its broken (cleavage)
surfaces. Much of it so strongly resembles lump rosin that the term
&ldquo;Rosin Jack&rdquo; is truly descriptive. Less commonly, a ruby red variety
occurs as crystals perched on other sphalerite or on waste rock.
Sphalerite is readily scratched with steel. Its chemical composition
is zinc sulphide, ZnS&mdash;zinc 67 per cent, sulphur 33 per cent&mdash;and it
is an important ore of zinc.</p>
<p>Sphalerite occurs abundantly in the mining district of southwest
Missouri, but small, non-commercial amounts of it have been found
through an area extending even north of the Missouri River. At
the mines, after the ore and rock are taken out, they are crushed
and separated, the ore going to the smelter and the rock to tailings
piles. Under the old milling process employed in south<i>western</i> Missouri,
thousands of tons of coarse tailings, largely chert, were poured
onto huge &ldquo;chat&rdquo; piles, many of which remain as a low-priced by-product
for some one to put to use. This chat differs mineralogically
from the south<i>eastern</i> Missouri chat, which is largely dolomite.</p>

Slightly bluish &ldquo;glass&rdquo; barite or &ldquo;glass tiff&rdquo; has been found in smaller

glassy barite may superficially resemble calcite or selenite gypsum,
but in distinction, barite breaks or cleaves to surfaces joining at right
angles and does not effervesce with acid, whereas calcite does effervesce
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
in acid and cleaves at oblique angles (rhombohedral cleavage).
Gypsum is so soft that it can be scratched very easily with the thumb-nail,
whereas barite is scratched with difficulty, if at all, by the thumb-nail.
Notably, again, barite is &ldquo;heavy,&rdquo; with a specific gravity of
about 4.5, whereas calcite, gypsum, limestone, and chert are &ldquo;lighter,&rdquo;
with a specific gravity of about 2.6 to 2.7. Barite has the composition
barium sulphate, BaSO&#8324;, of which barium oxide constitutes 65.7
per cent.</p>

<p class="pcap">Three pieces of barite, the crested and bladed form at the left, &ldquo;glass&rdquo; barite

</div>
<p>Barite occurs in abundance in the Jefferson-Washington counties
district, which furnishes about 80% of Missouri production. Other
production comes from near Houston, Texas county, and from the
central district&mdash;Miller, Moniteau, Morgan, Cole counties, and adjacent
territory. In the Jefferson-Washington counties district, it
is dug from residual clay over dolomite and is run through washing
and concentrating mills which remove the clay and lighter waste
rock. Most of the central district production comes from old sinkhole
deposits, the ore being also crushed, washed, and concentrated
in preparation for shipment. Missouri barite which was produced
during 1941 had a value of over $1,300,000 and constituted about
40% of the total United States productions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Barite is used as a paint pigment and extender, as a flux, as
a source of barium in the chemical industry, as a filler in rubber,
paper, oil cloth, textiles, and leather, and as a heavy substance in
oil well drilling mud. The largest single use is in the manufacture of
lithopone paint.</p>
<h3 id="c43"><b id="g_Gypsum">Gypsum</b></h3>
<p>Gypsum is a soft mineral which can be scratched easily with the
finger or thumb-nail. It may be glassy or transparent, or may grade
into an opaque white body, possibly stained by iron oxide, but it is
always very soft. Of the three varieties of gypsum&mdash;selenite, alabaster,
and satinspar&mdash;only the first two have been found in Missouri
by the writer. The chemical composition of gypsum is CaSO&#8324;&middot;2H&#8322;O.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/p28a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="572" />
<p class="pcap">Transparent, flexible variety of gypsum

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p28b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="479" />
<p class="pcap">Fine-grained, white, opaque gypsum
(alabaster).</p>
</div>
<p>The chief use of gypsum is in the manufacture of plaster of paris,
during which it is pulverized and heated to drive off part of the water
of crystallization so that its composition corresponds to CaSO&#8324;&middot;&frac12;H&#8322;O.
This powder, when mixed with water and poured into a mold, heats
and sets; that is, it hardens by taking up enough of the water to
restore its original composition.</p>
<p>Although thick, wide-spread beds of gypsum occur in other localities,
probably most of the gypsum in Missouri has been secondarily
formed, as from the reaction of sulphuric acid from oxidizing pyrite
on calcite; and its quantity is limited to small crystals, veins, and
crusts in or on other rocks. Gypsum may be an impurity in coal,
and some beautiful crystals a few inches long have been found in
weathering clay deposits. It therefore cannot be considered as a
commercially valuable mineral of this state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3 id="c44"><b id="g_Meteorites">Meteorites</b></h3>
<p>Meteorites, the rock-like specimens which have come to our earth
as sparkling meteors in the sky, are perhaps the most prized specimens
which the average collector hopes to find, and perhaps more
specimens are mistaken for meteorites than for any other geological
substance. Meteorites are rare and not easy to find; they are also
not easy to determine.</p>
<p>The iron variety is usually a heavy, roughly-pitted, brown, tough,
metallic, nickel alloy of iron. Therefore, a positive chemical test for
nickel is usually strongly suggestive of a meteoric origin, but confirmation
almost requires that a surface be polished and etched with
dilute acids to bring out typical and characteristic structures.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">

<p class="pcap">The polished and acid-etched surface of an iron meteorite. Shows the
Widmanstatten figures characteristic of iron meteorites. (Photo courtesy

</div>
<p>The stony variety of meteorites usually contains a rock-forming
mineral called olivine, beneath its pitted brown surface. In case of
either variety, since special equipment is required for final testing
and determination, it is recommended that this be done at a laboratory
appropriately equipped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h3 id="c45"><b id="g_Gold">Gold</b></h3>
<p>Gold is not known to occur in Missouri, except for very small
quantities which have been carried into the state with the glacial
deposits in the north half. Miners have searched carefully, and geologists
have studied Missouri rocks intently, comparing them with the
gold veins of the western states, but they find no promise of a gold
deposit in Missouri. We have been favored with other geological
products, but it is a waste of time to search for gold in Missouri.</p>
<h3 id="c46"><b id="g_Silver">Silver</b></h3>
<p>Silver has been recovered from ore in the Silver Mines area in
Madison county and from the galena of southeastern Missouri. Except
for occurrences within the igneous rock area and the lead mining
regions, geologists do not expect to find additional silver ore
deposits.</p>
<h3 id="c47"><b id="g_Diamonds">Diamonds</b></h3>
<p>No diamond has ever been found in native Missouri rock. It
is possible for diamonds to have been carried into the state with the
glacial deposits in the northern part, but the probability of finding
one, if it did come in, is extremely remote.</p>
<p>Diamonds do occur in one part of Arkansas, but those rocks are
strikingly different from all Missouri rocks except in a few localities,
having small areas about the size of one&rsquo;s house, in the southeastern
part of the state. The writer has received quartz and calcite crystals
for testing from persons who hoped they might be diamonds. It is
almost a foregone conclusion that diamonds do not occur in Missouri.</p>
<p>A diamond may be recognized by its extreme hardness. It is
the hardest substance known, natural or artificial, and will scratch any
known substance; but it, in turn, is scratched only by another diamond.
Acids do not affect diamonds in the least.</p>
<h3 id="c48">Uranium Minerals</h3>
<p>Three uranium-containing minerals, <a id="g_Tyuyamunite">tyuyamunite</a> (pronounced
tyew-yuh-moon-ite), possibly <a id="g_Carnotite">carnotite</a>, and
<a id="g_Metatorbernite">metatorbernite</a>, have been
found in Missouri but none has been mined commercially. Tyuyamunite
and carnotite are canary yellow powdery minerals so similar in
appearance they can be differentiated only by chemical and x-ray
properties. Both minerals contain uranium, vanadium, oxygen, water,
and one other element, which, if it is calcium, the mineral is tyuyamunite,
but if it is potassium the mineral is carnotite. The canary yellow
color referred to is distinctly different from the brownish or reddish
yellow color of iron oxide minerals. These yellow uranium minerals
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
have been found near Ste. Genevieve along cracks in limestone and
in the black shale above the limestone, and in dark, sandy shales near
Shelbina, and elsewhere north of the Missouri River.</p>
<p>Black shales (high in organic matter) of marine origin are the
most highly radioactive, whereas black shales deposited on land (as
with coal), and all shales of other colors are usually lower in radioactivity.</p>
<p>Metatorbernite is a soft, pale apple-green scaly mineral that has
been found in paper-thin cracks in flint fire clay deposits. It contains
uranium, copper, phosphorus, oxygen, and water. All of these uranium
minerals activate a Geiger counter.</p>
<h2 id="c49"><span class="small">MISCELLANEOUS ROCK STRUCTURES</span></h2>
<h3 id="c50">Concretions</h3>
<p>A concretion is an aggregate of inorganic matter in the shape,
roughly, of a ball, disc, rod, or irregular nodular body. Usually the
aggregation or accumulation started around a small center grain or
particle and continued in the growth of layers about it like the shells
of an onion, or in the growth of needle-like fibers which radiate from
the center like pins stuck into a spherical pin cushion. Concretions
vary in size from buck-shot (buck-shot concretions in the soil) to oddities
ten or twenty feet in diameter, or even longer in elongate
forms. The variety about one-sixteenth or one-thirty-second of an
inch in diameter is called an oolite (pronounced oh-oh-lite). Some
chert of southern Missouri, most of the diaspore and burley clay,
and a limestone cropping out near Louisiana, Missouri, are made up
partly to almost entirely of oolites. See <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>.</p>
<p>Concretions may be composed of pyrite, calcite, limonite, chert,
cemented sandstone, or even cemented clay. They are usually recognized
by their structure after the previously enclosing rock has been
eroded. Thus pyrite, limonite, or calcite (limestone) concretions
remain after shale has softened and washed away, chert remains after
limestone, and strongly cemented &ldquo;irony&rdquo; (limonite or hematite) or
siliceous sandstone concretions may be found on the outcrop where
the softer or less resistant host rock has been carried off. The irregular-shaped,
intergrown, nodular limestone concretions (sometimes
called &ldquo;loess-kinder&rdquo;, or loess dolls) in the upper part of loess deposits
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers can be found remaining
on rain-washed slopes. Limy, mudstone concretions and
brown iron carbonate concretions are abundant in certain localities
in northwestern and southeastern Missouri, where they are used as
oddities in rock gardens or walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
<p class="pcap">Concretions. Dark, limy concretion at left and brassy pyrite at center
and right. Note the inter-grown pair in center.</p>
</div>
<p>Some concretions are formed at the same general time as the
surrounding rock accumulates, but others may be formed years after
the surrounding rock has been buried or removed from the environment
of its formation. In either case, deposition of the mineral matter
follows the pattern of addition or &ldquo;growth&rdquo; from inside out. This
growth, of course, does not involve a life process like that of a plant
or animal. If two or more centers of deposition occur close together,
the several growing concretions may touch, intergrow, and develop
some weird forms, suggesting organic growth. However odd these
curiosities may become, there is no question that they are not fossils,
or evidence of life. Probably concretions excite the interest of persons
more than any other rock structure.</p>
<p>Ground water, carrying calcium carbonate, silica, or iron compounds
in solution, is a great concretion builder. It percolates through
sandstone or other permeable rock and slowly leaves behind enveloping
layers or additions of mineral matter, until a concretion is
formed, to remain hidden from view until its host rock is softened and
removed by the action of the weather.</p>
<h3 id="c51">Geodes</h3>
<p>A geode is usually a hollow, more or less spherical or ball-shaped
shell of mineral and crystal growth which has formed within surrounding
rock. Missouri geodes commonly vary in size from hickory nuts
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
to small watermelons, although neither direction of variation is limited.
They weather out abundantly at several localities in northeast
Missouri from the so-called Warsaw formation, a limy shale. Here
they are dark brown, rough and irregular on the outside, but where
broken open show many brilliant, glistening faces of intergrown
quartz crystals. Less frequently calcite, chalcedony, kaolinite, and
rarely millerite (nickel sulphide) may occur in Missouri geodes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="538" />
<p class="pcap">Typical small geode from northeastern Missouri.</p>
</div>
<p>The minerals and crystals of a geode grow inward from the walls
of a cavity in the rocks. The mineral matter is carried there in solution
by ground water and crystallizes out very much more slowly but
in the same manner that sugar or salt crystals develop in a saturated
solution of those substances. If crystal growth continues until the
geode is solid, it may bear superficial resemblance to a concretion,
but the latter structure is one which has grown outward. The idea
of &ldquo;growth&rdquo; in either case is that of mineral crystallization and enlargement,
but does not in the least involve life like that of a plant
or animal. Geodes have no value or use other than for ornamental
purposes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3 id="c52">Fossils</h3>
<p>Fossils are also found and collected by persons who are interested
in rocks and minerals. The varied remains of plants and animals
long since petrified or replaced by mineral matter have stimulated
the curiosity and become a source of enjoyment to many persons, from
those who merely give a passing glance to the peculiar organic structures
in the rocks to those who make a serious hobby or business of
collecting and classifying the unreplaceable heritage from the ancient
rocks. Fossils are interesting in part because of their variety, for
they include petrified wood, shells like those of oysters, fish teeth,
foot-prints, amber, dinosaur eggs, coal, imprints of fern leaves, of
insects, and of fishes, and the bones of small and gigantic dinosaurs
and elephants. In fact, a fossil is any evidence of life in the geologic
past preserved in the rocks. Missouri rocks furnish fossils ranging
in size from microscopically small fish teeth to the big skeletal remains
of the mastodon, an ancestor of the elephant; but the most common
ones are the structures and shells of ancient clams, corals, brachiopods,
crinoids, and trilobites.</p>

<p>The accompanying photographs illustrate a few fossils that may
be found within our state, but a thorough, non-technical treatment
of Missouri fossils is available in a companion volume to this booklet,
&ldquo;The Common Fossils of Missouri&rdquo; by Prof. A. G. Unklesbay, Missouri
Handbook No. 4.</p>
<p>The study of fossils, or paleontology, is a fascinating branch of
geology which extends far beyond the recognition and cataloging of
the specimens. It has been found that certain particular fossils
occur in rocks of the ages which produce petroleum, and the search
for that valuable substance has been directed in many instances by
the fossil content of the rocks. Rocks of different ages carry different
fossil assemblages, and a man skilled in paleontology utilizes the
fossils in dating geologic history like the page numbers in a book of
human history. Further, any student of present-day animals and
plants is aided in his understanding of them if he knows the fossil
record of their ancestors of the long geologic past.</p>
<h3 id="c53">Arrow Heads and Other Indian Artifacts</h3>
<p>Arrow heads, scrapers, rock knives and saws which were left
by the Indians who formerly lived in Missouri may be found in moderate
abundance in many parts of the state. Usually these artifacts
are chert in its various colors, white, gray, mottled, reddish, or black
(flint). See the discussion of chert on <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>. Chert, because of
its conchoidal fracture, lack of cleavage, resistance to chemical weathering,
and superior hardness, is an exceptionally useful rock for
making tools and weapons.</p>
<p>Hammers and axes of basalt, and arrow heads of rhyolite are
less abundant than the chert artifacts.</p>
<h2 id="c54"><span class="small">THE ROCKS OF MISSOURI</span></h2>
<p>Geologists classify rocks into these groups: igneous, sedimentary
or metamorphic. Representatives of all three have been described
in the preceding pages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Sedimentary rocks are those whose particles settled down through
the air or water to form rocks in layers or beds; hence layered,
bedded, or so-called stratified rocks are sedimentary rocks. For instance,
the sand and mud settling out of the Gulf of Mexico (or ocean)
after being brought in by the Mississippi River is on its way toward
becoming sandstone and shale. Limestone is forming off the coast of
Florida now. All of these rocks are accumulating in layers. Where
one sees regularly-layered or stratified rocks in streams, road cuts,
quarries, bluffs or hillsides, he expects them to be sedimentary rocks.
The sedimentary rocks that have been described herein include:</p>

<p>Igneous rocks are those which solidified from a hot liquid which
was either forced into older surrounding rocks (intrusive) or discharged
on the earth&rsquo;s surface as a lava flow or products from a
volcano (extrusive).</p>
<p>The examples given below illustrate the two types. Everyone
knows about the extrusive forms from accounts of present-day volcanoes
and occasional lava flows, like those of Vesuvius, Paricutin, and
Mauna Loa. An intrusion was injected beneath the Yellowstone Park
area years ago, and its heat, with steam and gases, is contributing
to the unusual natural features which are found in the park and which
make it famous.</p>

the effects of tremendous pressure (enough to raise mountains) and

rock results. The metamorphic rocks mentioned in this booklet are:</p>

<p>No doubt it has become apparent to the reader that rocks ordinarily
occur in great quantities, that they are composed of multitudes
of grains (mineral grains), and that their properties and compositions
vary with the different minerals which are present in the grains
of the rock. A <i>rock</i> can, therefore, be different from a <i>mineral</i>. In
fact, a rock may be defined as &ldquo;an aggregate of mineral particles,&rdquo;
or more broadly &ldquo;a typical part of the earth.&rdquo; To focus closer attention
on minerals we may discuss them for their own sake below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c55"><span class="small">MINERALS OF MISSOURI</span></h2>
<p>A mineral is characterized by a constancy of composition and of
properties which sets it apart from rocks which vary widely. Minerals
may be metallic, like pyrite, or non-metallic, like barite; they
may be ore, like galena, or rock-forming, like quartz or feldspar; they
may show crystal faces, or they may be fragments with rounded or
broken surfaces. A favored definition teaches that &ldquo;a mineral is a
naturally occurring, inorganic substance having a definite chemical
composition and definite physical properties, within limits.&rdquo; The

<h2 id="c56"><span class="small">GEOLOGIC VALUES</span></h2>
<p>Although the emphasis in this pamphlet has been on the recognition
of Missouri rocks and minerals, it is not out of order to consider
the broad values that they contribute to our civilization. Their
use as building materials has been noted, but it should be further
recognized that as our timber is being rapidly depleted more and
more structures will be built out of earth materials. Missouri possesses
a wealth of beautiful limestone that is serviceable and readily
quarried. Where limestone is not near, there is usually shale or glacial
clay which can be used in the manufacture of brick and tile.
Permanency will be the keynote of the rock and ceramic structures.
Gravel and sand are abundant in Missouri for concrete and other
varied uses.</p>
<p>The soil is Missouri&rsquo;s most valuable earth material. Hundreds
to thousands of years of normal weathering are required to develop
the rocks and minerals and texture of the inorganic fraction of the
soil. We should preserve it and prevent disastrous soil erosion.</p>
<p>Aside from these more tangible values, a fascinating and instructive
hobby can be made of collecting, arranging, and studying
rocks and minerals. One gains a fuller understanding and appreciation
of nature from their study. The orderliness, constancy, and
interrelation within the rock and mineral &ldquo;world&rdquo; is a restful contrast
to the one which man often keeps in turmoil. The beauty of a
glistening crystal or a polished mineral or stone is as inspiring as
a lovely flower, yet it lasts and lasts through centuries, a veritable
&ldquo;rock of ages.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
